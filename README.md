# LED_Matrix-16x16

<h4>
A 16x 16 (16 rows and 16 columns) LED_Matrix controlled by Arduino UNO and 4x IC74hc595 shift registers.
The main aim of making this project is to make small monitors, which are used in daily life devices, 
making them more useful, efficient, omnipresent and portable. In this project we are using the LED Matrix 
as a monitor to display the games that the user will play using the joystick mounted on the project board.
</h4>

<h4>The working of Matrix includes given stages: </h4>
<h4>
  <ol>
    <li>When the user turns on the game it asks for which game user wants to play.</li>
    <li>Then it starts the game as per the option chosen by the user.</li>
    <li>The user starts playing the games.</li>
    <li>Then it shows the score of the user, and if the user makes the score more      
      than the highest score then it will update the highest score. </li>
  </ol>
